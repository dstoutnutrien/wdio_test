# The internet is broken

We're trying to test https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ but, it's going horribly. Goodness gracious, barely any tests are green. Please help us by doing the following:

1. Pull this repo.
2. Fix as much as you can.
3. Make any changes you feel would make this better.
4. Make a PR.

## Node JS

The recommended node version is v18.20.2
We recommend using nvm to install and manage node versions. It can be found at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.

## Running Tests

Run tests with `npm run wdio` or `npm run wdio-headless`

Run specific tests with `npm run wdio -- --cucumberOpts.tagExpression="@TAG"`

#### You are our only hope.
